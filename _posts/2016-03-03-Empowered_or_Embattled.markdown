### Like many other fragments of information that trickle out of the black box of China’s leadership, the new usage of the term “hexin” could mean several different—opposing—things.

#### A new turn of phrase &hellip;

A sudden, novel use of the term “核心” (*hexin*,
 or “core” in English) to describe General Secretary Xi Jinping
generated a stir in China-watcher circles recently.  The new use
appeared early in 2016, as dozens of municipal and provincial cadres
employed the novel phrase (坚决维护习近平总书记这个核心, or “resolutely safeguard the
core, General Secretary Xi Jinping”) in [successive](http://news.xinhuanet.com/local/2016-02/01/c_1117954713.htm) [rounds](http://www.gz.xinhuanet.com/2016-02/04/c_1117987523.htm) of [meetings](http://news.ifeng.com/a/20160131/47307703_0.shtml).  The actual phrase, as described in the graphic below, is slightly but notably different from previous uses of *hexin* to talk about China’s General Secretary.


Importantly, the central propaganda apparatus has not yet given the
phrase a public stamp of approval, such as including it in central Party
 documents or in original reporting from authoritative PRC media
outlets.  Yet, it is reasonable to assume that the rollout of the new
phrase was coordinated in some fashion, since it was repeated verbatim
in a rapid succession of a large number of sub-national meetings. But
it remains unclear where exactly—or why—the phrase was generated. <br/>

#### &hellip; and several ways to interpret it


Beijing does not generally introduce such shifts in phrasing
willy-nilly, particularly when discussing the central leadership.  So if
 this new term is a signal of changed leadership politics or priorities,
 what does it mean?  Two common explanations use the same phrase to
buttress opposing theories:
* Xi “[has turned the page on crushing the cabal of senior officials who opposed his ascension](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/world/asia/china-president-xi-jinping-core.html?_r=2)”
 and seeks the “formidable stature once held by Deng Xiaoping.”  The
wording in Chinese of this new phrase does indeed feel highly
personalized (the phrasing clearly puts the grammatical focus on Xi
Jinping, rather than on the Central Committee leadership), and the
re-introduction of the word “core” is notable.
* Xi seeks to put on a linguistic show of strength to belie the “[internal opposition and party infighting](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-02/push-to-elevate-xi-s-party-status-could-shape-china-s-leadership)”
 he faces in the lead-up to the next Party Congress. The term
“safeguard” does call to mind the need for protection and suggests
danger.




The fact that China watchers use this piece of
evidence to support contradictory narratives means that additional
information will be needed for a correct interpretation, and perhaps
will be provided by authoritative outlets in the coming months.  
Whatever the ultimate origin of new phrase, it is a reminder that,
because of our limited insight into Zhongnanhai, we should remain
cautious about rushing to interpret official signals – especially ones that can be used to support opposing theories.


In the meantime, we should also ask ourselves which leadership
precedent we are focusing on. Much of the commentary surrounding the new
 phrase focuses on the use of *hexin* (“core”) as a way for Xi to
put himself on equal footing with Deng Xiaoping (either as a means of
self-aggrandizement or as a way of papering over leadership
weaknesses).  Yet, the word *hexin* was [initially used to describe Jiang Zemin](http://chinainstitute.anu.edu.au/morrison/morrison61.pdf).  It was only later retroactively applied to Deng and Mao Zedong.


 In contrast, the word *hexin* largely fell out of use during the Hu Jintao administration.  *Hexin* was [used very occasionally](http://www.qstheory.cn/tbzt/sqjlz/zgtsshzywh/zyllwz/201201/t20120112_134586.htm) in
 Party-affiliated media, but in general, the central leadership under Hu
 was referred to as以胡锦涛同志为总书记的党中央, or “the Central Committee with
Comrade Hu Jintao as General Secretary.”  And, in many cases,
authoritative PRC media still use that same phrase to describe Xi.

\**These turns of phrase were also used retroactively to describe Mao and
Deng and continued to be used for these three leaders during Hu&rsquo;s
tenure.*
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, the reintroduction of the word *hexin* in
 this new phrase may signal a desire to return to pre-Hu precedent,
attempting to reassert the General Secretary’s position as a strong
leader and a centre of gravity for the country.  In terms of leadership
propaganda, this would make [Hu Jintao the exception](http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64093/95111/95113/10024144.html), not Xi Jinping.
