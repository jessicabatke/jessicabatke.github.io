Party
 Congress political reports represent the Chinese Communist Party’s
policy goals and guidance for the following five years, codifying policy
 trends already underway and presaging policy emphases to come. Though
the reports are lengthy (and sometimes soporific), they are nonetheless
worth a close read, as their [content is](https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/clm53am.pdf)
 “set down with great precision: wording matters, even if the concrete
significance of a formulation is not immediately apparent.” What does
the 19th Party Congress political report have to say about NGOs, and how
 does this compare with what was said in the 18th Party Congress report?

Neither the [19th Party Congress political report](http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/19cpcnc/2017-10/27/c_1121867529.htm) (issued in October 2017) nor the [18th Party Congress political report](http://news.xinhuanet.com/18cpcnc/2012-11/17/c_113711665.htm)
 (issued in November 2012) actually use the term “non-governmental
organization” (非政府组织), nor do they specifically address international
NGOs. Instead, they use the phrase “social organization” (社会组织), the de
rigueur official term that encompasses several more specific types of
domestic non-profit registrations: social groups (社会团体), private
non-enterprises (民办非企业单位), and foundations (基金会). The reports’
discussion of social organizations, however, still offers insights into
the Party’s official views on civil society and what both domestic and
international groups might expect going forward.

Overall, references to social organizations are few and far between.
The 2017 report mentions them five times; the 2012 report three. Both
reports bring up social organizations in their sections on social
development, and they use very similar linguistic formulations to
recommend that the Party “leverage the role of social organizations”
(发挥社会组织作用) in social governance. They both also describe a social
governance system [in which](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/download/Xi_Jinping's_report_at_19th_CPC_National_Congress.pdf)
 “Party committees exercise leadership, government assumes
responsibility, non-governmental actors provide assistance, and the
public get involved” (党委领导、政府负责、社会协同、公众参与).

Yet, the 2012 report further states that the Party should “guide
social organizations to develop in a healthy and orderly way”
(引导社会组织健康有序发展) and [should establish](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/18th_CPC_National_Congress_Eng/t992917.htm)
 “a system of modern social organizations in which functions of the
government are separated from those of social organizations, rights and
responsibilities are clearly established, and social organizations
exercise autonomy in accordance with the law” (政社分开、权责明确、依法自治的现代社会组织体制).
 The 2017 report contains no comparable language, likely because 2016’s
Charity Law fulfilled the need to establish such a system.

Both reports also address social organizations in their sections on
Party-building, stating that the Party must strengthen the role of Party
 groups within social organizations. The 2017 report further says that
the Party should seek to recruit new members from social organizations,
among other places.

The 2017 report also touches on social organizations in two
additional sections. In the section on the political system, it says
that the Party should expand “consultative democracy,” increasing
consultation with social organizations (along with political parties,
people’s congresses, the government, Chinese People’s Political
Consultative Conference committees, mass organizations, and the
grassroots). In the section on the environment, it states that the Party
 will create an “environmental governance system,” led by the
government, in which enterprises assume the main responsibility—and in
which social organizations and the public have a participatory role.

This comparison of the 18th and 19th Party Congress political reports
 suggests that the Party’s fundamental view of civil society
organizations has not significantly changed. Civil society is a tool to
be used to help better understand citizens’ concerns, assist in social
service provision, and prevent widespread discontent before it starts;
it does not have a role independent of the government’s overarching
leadership. Indeed, domestic civil society groups should have Party
representation within them.

The key difference, then, is that the 2017 report proposes an
enhanced role for social organizations in the environmental sphere. This
 implies that Party sees an active and positive—though not leading—role
for civil society groups in this field.
