***A review of the work performed over the past few years by the
National People’s Congress and its Standing Committee—the body
that “turns the party’s propositions into the will of the
state”—can provide a clear synopsis of the Chinese Communist
Party’s governance priorities, and confirms the importance of two
major Chinese Communist Party objectives: addressing traditional and
non-traditional national security challenges as well as boosting
citizens’ identification of the Chinese Communist Party’s
ideological narratives.  It also reveals the enhanced role of the
National People’s Congress Standing Committee in the process of
authorizing pilot governance reforms.***

The Fifth Plenary Session of the 12th National People’s Congress
(NPC) took place in early March per custom, issuing its annual report using
language “dry as toast” to summarize the previous year’s work and lay out its
plans for the coming year.[<sup>1</sup>](#sdendnote1sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote1anc"></a> The annual NPC conclave is often rightly derided as more pomp than
substance, as much of the country’s legislative work is done outside this
roughly 10-day window.  The NPC itself is also often described as a
“rubber-stamp parliament,” as it does not have a particularly strong history of
voting down initiatives backed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
 Indeed, observers noted this year that NPC members’ votes dissenting on the
work reports of government agencies appeared to decline to historic lows.[<sup>2</sup>](#sdendnote2sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote2anc"></a> For the CCP, this is a feature, not a bug, as
described in the 2012 18<sup>th</sup> Party Congress Work Report: “We should
make good use of legal procedures to turn the party’s propositions into the
will of the state” (要善于使党的主张通过法定程序成为国家意志).[<sup>3</sup>](#sdendnote3sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote3anc"></a>

 This lack of party-state separation, however, does allow us
to view the NPC’s legislative work as a representation of CCP governance
priorities.  This is especially true given the party’s increased emphasis on
making China a “rule of law country” (法治国家)—always, of course, in service of
the CCP’s continued rule.[<sup>4</sup>](#sdendnote4sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote4anc"></a> Whether or not these laws have their intended
effects once released into the wilds of local Chinese government, they still
serve as useful signals about the focus of the central authorities, and of what
messages these authorities hope to convey to their own people.  

 A review of recent NPC Standing Committee (NPCSC) work
reports offers an overview of the CCP and of the government’s evolving
priorities.[<sup>5</sup>](#sdendnote5sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote5anc"></a>
 (The NPCSC work report, as compared to the full NPC work report, is more
focused on specific legislation and implementation.  This befits the
Standing Committee’s role as the primary body reviewing and enacting
legislation throughout the year.)  Similarly,
a review of the 10th, 11th, and 12th NPCs’ legislative calendar, including both
the laws that passed as well as those that never made it off the docket, is
helpful in parsing the PRC’s governing strategy and the NPC’s role in helping
enact it.  In particular, we can see certain shifts in emphasis toward
national security issues, fields that touch on ideology and national
narratives, as well as central-level legal coordination of local pilot reform
efforts.[<sup>6</sup>](#sdendnote6sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote6anc"></a>

#### Elevated—and Expansive—Security Concerns

For the second year in a row, national security concerns are
front and center in the NPCSC work report.  This is especially conspicuous
in light of the fact that “national security” received almost no attention in
the NPCSC work reports prior to 2015.  In
terms of legislative priorities, national security issues have been markedly
elevated in the last few years.  This undoubtedly reflects China’s larger
role on the world stage and its attendant sense of vulnerability to
transnational threats.

 “National security” in this context encompasses a very broad
swath of concerns.  Notably, the 2017 NPCSC Work Report lists 2016’s
Foreign NGO Law—alongside 2014’s Counter-Espionage Law, 2015’s National
Security and Anti-Terrorism Laws, 2016’s Cybersecurity and National Defense
Transportation Laws—as part of its recent suite of national security
legislation.  While the Foreign NGO Law might well “protect [NGOs’]
legitimate rights and interests and promote exchange and cooperation” (利于保护其合法权益，促进正常交流与合)
as stated in the 2017 Work Report, its inclusion in the “national security”
section of the report clearly signals the general prism through which foreign
NGOs are viewed by Chinese leaders.

#### Shoring Up Educational and Cultural Bulwarks

Recent years have also seen an increase in legislation
related to cultural and educational issues.  As other observers have pointed
out, the 12th NPC has, as compared to the previous five-year session, shifted
toward legislation focused on social and cultural issues.[<sup>7</sup>](#sdendnote7sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote7anc"></a>  Though the NPCSC work reports themselves
generally lump these pieces of legislation together under the rubric of “living
standards” or “cultural, social, environmental, and other,” it is also possible
to view them, at least in part, in tandem with the national security
legislation discussed above.  Indeed, multiple statements by high-level party
and state leaders make it clear that they view some cultural and educational
governance efforts as a bulwark against ideological infiltration from the West.
 Both General Secretary Xi Jinping and Education Minister Chen Baosheng
have made statements in recent months about the need to strengthen the role and
appeal of ideology in higher education.[<sup>8</sup>](#sdendnote8sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote8anc"></a> This
follows a high-level party “opinion” in 2015 on strengthening “thought work” in
universities and admonishments by the erstwhile education minister to not use
teaching materials that “disseminate Western values.”[<sup>9</sup>](#sdendnote9sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote9anc"></a>

Similarly, strengthening Chinese culture is meant to
mitigate foreign cultural influences.  Even
seemingly unrelated laws, like the new law on traditional Chinese medicine,
contain a cultural component, such as boosting China’s soft power.[<sup>10</sup>](#sdendnote10sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote10anc"></a> In its later years, the previous
administration stepped up efforts on this front, exemplified in General
Secretary Hu Jintao’s 2012 article on
resisting Western cultural infiltration by developing a strong socialist
culture.[<sup>11</sup>](#sdendnote11sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote11anc"></a> The Hu administration also established or renamed
two party leading small groups related to culture in 2011 and 2012.[<sup>12</sup>](#sdendnote12sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote12anc"></a> Under the current administration, culture had
a relatively small but significant role in 2016’s 13<sup>th</sup> Five-Year
Plan.[<sup>13</sup>](#sdendnote13sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote13anc"></a>

Table 2 (below) illustrates the increase in legislation
related to cultural and educational issues over the past three National People’s
Congresses.

#### Heroes, Holidays, and the Constitution

Hand in hand with resisting baneful foreign ideological
influences go the PRC’s efforts to construct its own positive and appealing
national narrative.  This often features China’s past as a downtrodden
nation subject to high-handed foreign bullying—and the CCP’s central and
irreplaceable role in restoring China’s rightful place as a powerful
international player.  The urgent need for these national narratives
underpins a much-discussed provision in the Civil Code (民法总则, sometimes
translated as the General Provisions of Civil Law or the General Rules of Civil
Law) passed at the March NPC meeting, that prohibits defaming the country’s
past “heroes and martyrs.”[<sup>14</sup>](#sdendnote14sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote14anc"></a>

This provision also fits in with other recent NPC actions
reaffirming the importance of such national narratives.  In 2014, the NPCSC issued a spate of decisions
marking new national days of remembrance.
September 3 is now the “Victory Day in the Chinese People’s War of
Resistance against Japanese Aggression” (中国人民抗日战争胜利纪念日), September 30 “Martyrs’ Day” (烈士纪念日), and December 13 the “National Memorial Day for Nanjing
Massacre Victims” (南京大屠杀死难者国家公祭日).[<sup>15</sup>](#sdendnote15sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote15anc"></a> About the latter, the 2015 NPCSC Work Report
noted that “the solemn commemoration of such events through memorial activities
has greatly promoted patriotism and core socialist values.”

Atop a foundation of historical narratives, the PRC is
hoping to construct modern ones extolling the fairness of the current
governance system.  In 2014, the NPCSC
established “Constitution Day” (国家宪法日),
and in 2015 issued its decision on “implementing the system for
institutionalizing pledges of allegiance to the constitution” (实行宪法宣誓制度).[<sup>16</sup>](#sdendnote16sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote16anc"></a> In its 2016 work report the NPCSC wrote, “the
words of the pledge embody the sense of loyalty, responsibility, and commitment
that public servants are expected to have toward their country and people &hellip;
[and will urge] public servants to remain loyal to, comply with, and safeguard
the Constitution.”  This effort almost
certainly has another function, and that is to put on public display the CCP’s
commitment to continuing to mold China into a “rule of law country.”

#### The NPCSC Weighs In on Pilot Reforms

Over the past few years, the NPCSC appears to have taken on
a more active role in the authorization of pilot reform projects (试点).  Local policy
experimentation in China is nothing new, of course, but historically much of it
occurred in advance of legislative review or involvement.[<sup>17</sup>](#sdendnote17sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote17anc"></a>
 It remains unclear exactly how the NPCSC
decides which projects require its authorization, but the projects as listed in
recent years’ work reports appear to involve either the Supreme People’s Court
and Supreme People’s Procuratorate (over which the NPC has direct oversight) or
prominent trials that might violate or be excessively constrained by existing
laws.  As explained in the 2016 NPCSC Work Report, “For proposed reforms
that come into conflict with existing laws, and for which the conditions for
revising the relevant laws do not exist and trials are required first, the
Standing Committee may act in accordance with the prescribed legal procedures
to grant authorization for preliminary reform trials to be conducted, thereby
providing the necessary legal basis and support for trial reforms in certain
regions or particular sectors.”

Repeated reference to NPCSC involvement in pilot reform projects
first cropped up in the 2015 NPCSC Work Report, which reviewed the work of the
previous year.  Yet this effort seems to flow
from more general goals laid
out in the CCP’s 18<sup>th</sup> Party Congress Work Report in 2012: “We
should support people’s congresses and their standing committees in fully
playing their role as organs of state power, in exercising legislative,
oversight, policymaking, and personnel appointment and dismissal powers in
accordance with the law, in strengthening organization and coordination of
legislative work, in stepping up their oversight of people’s governments,
courts, and procuratorates, and in tightening examination and oversight of all
government budgets and final accounts.”[<sup>18</sup>](#sdendnote18sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote18anc"></a> The CCP had called for a more active NPCSC as
far back as 2005, when the Central Committee approved and recirculated the
NPCSC Party Leadership Groups’ “decision on giving further play to the role of
National People’s representatives and strengthening the construction of the
National People’s Congress Standing Committee system” (中共全国人大常委会党组关于进一步发挥全国人大代表作用加强全国人大常委会制度建设的若干意见).[<sup>19</sup>](#sdendnote19sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote19anc"></a>

The following describes the pilot reform projects or adjustments
to law for which the NPCSC has issued authorizing decisions, as enumerated in
the 2015, 2016, and 2017 NPCSC Work Reports:
* Supreme People’s Court and Supreme People’s
Procuratorate pilot of a criminal sentence bargaining system in 18 cities (最高人民法院、最高人民检察院在部分地区开展刑事案件认罪认罚从宽制度试点工作) (2016)
* Provisional adjustments to laws that affect the public
servant salary system pilot reform (在部分地区和部分在京中央机关暂时调整适用《中华人民共和国公务员法》有关规定) (2016)
* Provisional adjustments to laws that affect
maternity insurance pilot reform (在河北省邯郸市等12个试点城市行政区域暂时调整适用《中华人民共和国社会保险法》有关规定) (2016)
* Provisional
adjustments to laws that affect the military officers system pilot reform (军官制度改革期间暂时调整适用相关法律规定) (2016)
* Trial
reform of the people’s assessors system (在部分地区开展人民陪审员制度改革试点工作) (2015)
* Trials for filing public interest litigation (最高人民检察院在部分地区开展公益诉讼试点工作) (2015)
* Pilot program of a marketing authorization
holder system for drugs and relevant issues (在部分地方开展药品上市许可持有人制度试点和有关问题) (2015)
* Trials to allow the mortgaging of contracted
rural land-use rights and farmers’ home property rights (在部分行政区域分别暂时调整实施有关法律规定) (2015)
* Adjustment to the applicability of certain
stipulations in the Securities Law in order to implement reforms related to a
new initial public offering registration system (在实施股票发行注册制改革中调整适用证券法有关规定) (2015)
* Provisional adjustments to items requiring
government review for the three new pilot free-trade zones in Guangdong,
Tianjin, and Fujian, as well as for the extended areas of the China (Shanghai)
Pilot Free-Trade Zone (在中国
[广东]、中国
[天津]、中国 [福建] 自由贸易试验区以及中国 [上海] 自由贸易试验区扩展区域暂时调整有关法律规定的行政审批) (2014)
* Provisional
adjustments to the enforcement of certain laws in 33 pilot counties,
county-level cities, and districts including Daxing District of Beijing (在北京市大兴区等三十三个试点县 [市、区] 行政区域暂时调整实施有关法律规定) (2015)
* Supreme People’s Court and Supreme People’s
Procuratorate pilot of accelerated procedures for certain criminal cases in
some localities (最高法、最高检在部分地区开展刑事案件速裁程序试点工作) (2014)



The NPCSC is also involved in a major pilot project of its
own.  Following CCP Central Committee
guidance issued in
November, the NPCSC issued a decision in December declaring that local
people’s congresses will carry out pilot reforms in Beijing, Shanxi Province,
and Zhejiang Province.[<sup>20</sup>](#sdendnote20sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote20anc"></a> The pilot reforms entail local people’s
congresses in pilot areas establishing “supervisory committees” (监察委员会) to
oversee government employees’ exercise of public power.  As others have noted, this
appears to be the first step in combining the authorities of multiple
anti-corruption organs, including the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection, which will then be subject to NPC oversight.[<sup>21</sup>](#sdendnote21sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote21anc"></a>

#### Looking forward to the Final Year of the 12th NPC

The 2017 Work Report lays out what the NPCSC plans to
accomplish in its final year, before the 13th NPC is inaugurated next spring.
 (It is worth noting that the CCP’s 19th Party Congress, which could
feature either a significant personnel reshuffle or herald a fundamental change
in the informal leadership selection system, will occur this fall and could
affect the NPC legislative calendar in unexpected ways.)  

It lists four major legislative priorities, one of which is
to continue authorizing pilot reforms.  Thus, we should expect continued
NPC involvement in certain pilot projects for at least this year, if not
longer, as suggested by the 18<sup>th</sup> Party Congress Work Report.  As
a separate line item, the NPCSC plans to continue its work on the supervisory
system pilot reform, including revising the Administration Supervision Law (行政监察法).

Under the rubric of “social, cultural, ecological, and
other” issues, the NPCSC pledges further work on cultural issues in the form of
the Public Libraries Law, which appears to have been largely stalled after
comments were solicited at the end of 2015.  And significantly, though
left unaddressed in this article, the NPCSC will compile the individual books
of the civil code as a follow-on to the passing of the General Provisions of
Civil Law this year.


In a section about oversight of other government entities, the work report
notes that the NPCSC will continue to emphasize enforcement of the constitution.
 It is unclear what this might mean in terms of concrete, on-the-ground
enforcement, as the only concrete events the work report mentions are National
Constitution Day and ceremonies for pledging allegiance to the constitution.
 Regardless, the rhetorical stress placed on the constitution is
meaningful and signals that Chinese leaders are still seeking ways to realign
local officials’ priorities and bolster citizens’ sense that they do indeed live
in a “rule of law country.”
