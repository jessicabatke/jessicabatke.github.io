>Prior to 2017, China expert Jessica Batke describes the workings of foreign NGOs in China as the “Wild West,” with vague regulations that were not enforced.
>
This changed in January 2017, when China passed the Foreign NGO Law (FNGO). The legislation allows the Chinese government to have more oversight and supervision of foreign NGOs in China.
>
Batke, senior editor of ChinaFile, explains that although the new legislation will provide a better framework for NGOs operating in China, it could have dire effects on those organizations promoting advocacy or NGOs whose objectives do not align with those of the Chinese government.
