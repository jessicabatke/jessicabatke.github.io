**On December 16, 2020, the Center for Strategic and International Studies hosted a discussion examining the recent steps governments have taken to address the widespread human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and outlining possible new approaches that an incoming Biden administration might adopt. CSIS's Amy Lehr and Jude Blanchette hosted the discussion, which included Megha Rajagopalan, Sheena Chestnut Greitens, and me. Further information is available on the CSIS's [event page](https://www.csis.org/events/online-event-stopping-human-rights-abuses-xinjiang-whats-worked-what-hasnt-and-whats-next).**
