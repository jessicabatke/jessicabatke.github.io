***After the 19th Party Congress last fall and the recent “two meetings” in March, the party-state has now completed its quinquennial leadership turnover and announced a major restructuring of a number of party and state entities. This institutional restructuring will alter slightly the functional hierarchies involved in coordinating Xinjiang policy, but there is no indication that it—or the new leaders in place—will affect the content or tone of that policy. Whether regional Party Secretary Chen Quanguo himself is the progenitor of increasingly repressive measures now employed in Xinjiang, or whether he is simply the most ruthless tool by which to implement them, he is still the logical endpoint of the party’s broader policy trajectory.***

### Central Leadership: Two Key Policymaking Constellations

There are two main
constellations of bureaucratic agencies that have the most influence
over policy and implementation in Xinjiang: those engaged in “United
Front” work, and those in the “Politics and Law” ambit. These
constellations comprise both party and state bodies, though now more
than ever the party is clearly the center of gravity. In addition,
there is the Central Committee Xinjiang Work Coordination Small Group
(中央新疆工作协调小组),
formed in 2000, that brings together leaders from both of these
policy hierarchies—as well as from others—to provide guidance on
Xinjiang policy. We know very little about the individuals in these
agencies beyond what the party wants us to know, but nothing in their
résumés—or in official policy guidance—suggests that we should
expect any new leaders or new institutional arrangements to
substantively alter the policy course in Xinjiang.


#### United Front Hierarchy

The United Front
Work Department (UFWD), a party entity, falls under the leadership of
Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC) member and Chinese People’s
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Chairman Wang Yang. With
provincial-level leadership experience in Anhui, Chongqing, and
Guangdong, as well as several years under his belt as a vice premier
in the State Council, Wang has no obvious experience managing issues
particular to the United Front. Yet neither did his predecessor, Yu
Zhengsheng, who worked his way up through Shandong, Hubei, and
Shanghai, and who oversaw progressively more repressive policies
applied in both Tibet and Xinjiang.[<sup>1</sup>](#sdendnote1sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote1anc"></a>


Two of the
institutional changes outlined at the recent National People’s
Congress, in bringing government entities under the formal leadership
of the UFWD, have possible implications for Xinjiang. The State
Ethnic Affairs Commission (SEAC), though it will continue to exist as
a department under the State Council, is now also explicitly under
the authority of the UFWD. The State Administration for Religious
Affairs (SARA) will be absorbed directly into the UFWD and will no
longer exist as an independent entity.


Yet it is hard to
imagine that either of these shifts portends a significant
substantive change for the PRC’s ethnic or religious policies in
Xinjiang. It is not as if SEAC and SARA were previously rogue
agencies formulating regulations that contravened the party’s
wishes. If anything, the move codifies the lines of authority that
have long been obvious. Further, the UFWD had already established a
Xinjiang Bureau in 2017, so as an institution it has already had
specially designated staff to manage Xinjiang-related issues.[<sup>2</sup>](#sdendnote2sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote2anc"></a>

#### Politics and Law Hierarchy

The Central
Committee Politics and Law Commission (PLC; see table 2) is a party
body that oversees the country’s security apparatus as well as its
justice system, and as such has as its members the heads of all the
relevant state agencies in charge of implementing its policies. The
PLC secretary used to be a PBSC member, but after the spectacular
fall from grace of PLC head Zhou Yongkang, the position was
downgraded to the Politburo level. Some observers speculate that the
absorption of several leading small groups into the PLC, announced as
part of the larger party-state restructuring plan, has boosted the
PLC’s bureaucratic power, but notably the PLC secretary remains at
the Politburo, and not the PBSC, level.


Since the 19<sup>th</sup>
Party Congress last fall, Guo Shengkun, former minister of Public
Security, heads the PLC. Guo is also the First Political Commissar of
the People’s Armed Police (PAP), a paramilitary organization that
is a major component of Xinjiang’s security strategy and that only
recently shifted from joint civilian-military oversight to sole
military oversight.


The impact and role
of these agencies can be quite obvious—when talking about rounding
people up or putting down ongoing unrest, the Ministry of Public
Security (MPS) and the PAP have a clear role. But other agencies have
a large impact as well. As discussed further below, the official
policy document that appears to explicitly mandate the establishment
of the “training centers” was issued by the Xinjiang Department
of Justice. Whether or not the specific plan for the centers was
formulated at the central or regional level, the Justice hierarchy is
clearly intimately involved. Fu Zhenghua, now minister of justice, is
a Politics and Law veteran. He was previously vice-minister of public
security, head of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, head of the
“610 Office” general office (the implementing arm of the party
group devoted to “handling the problem of evil cults”), and has
already served a brief stint on the PLC. He was also reportedly part
of the effort to investigate the crimes of former PLC Secretary Zhou
Yongkang—not a task for the faint of heart.

#### Central Committee Xinjiang Work Coordination Small Group


The Central Committee Xinjiang Work Coordination Small Group is one
of a number of “leading small groups” (LSGs, which function as
policy advisory bodies) in the PRC party-state.[<sup>3</sup>](#sdendnote3sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote3anc"></a>
Prior to the Zhou Yongkong affair, the head of the PLC (and a PBSC
member) also headed the Xinjiang LSG. However, even after leadership
of the PLC was downgraded from the PBSC to the Politburo level in
2012, leadership of the Xinjiang LSG remained at the PBSC level—an
indication of the importance the central leadership accords
Xinjiang-related issues. CPPCC Chairman Yu Zhengsheng became head of
the Xinjiang LSG, as will, presumably, new CPPCC Chairman Wang Yang.
A similar shift happened with the Xinjiang LSG Office Director: the
role used to be filled by a PLC member, but is now apparently the job
of the SEAC Director (which is part of the United Front rather than
the Politics and Law hierarchy). This shift in which hierarchy leads
the Xinjiang LSG has not reduced central policy emphasis on security,
however. This accords with the United Front’s consistent oversight
of Tibet work over time even as security apparatus’ footprint has
increased in Tibet.[<sup>4</sup>](#sdendnote4sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote4anc"></a> 


The Xinjiang LSG does not as yet appear to be affected by the
recently announced institutional restructuring, but it is possible
that changes to SEAC’s status, for example, may end up altering the
LSG’s institutional composition. Though the party has never
published a formal, full list of Xinjiang LSG members for public
consumption, the names and positions of several former members have
been reported in official media, on government websites, and in
state-affiliated media. Using this information, and using the
individuals’ concurrent positions as a guide, we can guess who
might sit on the latest incarnation of the Xinjiang LSG. See table 3.

The table only
includes concurrent job titles of confirmed LSG members. The entire
LSG membership is undoubtedly larger, and tidbits occasionally
appearing in the media suggest that representatives from a range of
other ministries are part of the LSG. The Ministry of Agriculture for
example, apparently has a seat at the Xinjiang LSG table.[<sup>5</sup>](#sdendnote5sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote5anc"></a>

One report from 2012
states that Zhou Yongkang led 15 members of the Xinjiang LSG to the
region.[<sup>6</sup>](#sdendnote6sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote6anc"></a>
The number of officials listed as going on the trip is larger than
15, so it is difficult to know which of these individuals were
definitively on the LSG at the time, but it is an instructive list
nonetheless (individuals’ concurrent job titles in 2012 are shown
in parentheses):
* Zhu Weiqun
	朱维群
	(UFWD executive deputy director)
* Zhou Benshun
	周本顺
	(PLC secretary-general)\*
* Yang Huanning
	杨焕宁
	(MPS executive vice minister and Central Committee Stability
	Preservation Work Leading Small Group office director)\*
* Jiang Weixin
	姜伟新
	(minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development)
* Wang Yong 王勇
	(head of the State-owned Assets Supervision and
	Administration)
* Wang Qinfeng
	王秦丰
	(deputy head of the Central Committee Organization
	Department)
* Cai Mingzhao
	蔡名照
	(deputy head of the Propaganda Department)
* Bao Shaokun
	鲍绍坤
	(PLC deputy secretary-general?)
* Du Ying 杜鹰
	(National Development and Reform Commission Deputy head)\*
* Li Weihong
	李卫红
	(vice minister of Education)[<sup>7</sup>](#sdendnote7sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote7anc"></a>
* Su Bo 苏波
	(vice minister of Industry and Information Technology)
* Wang Zuo’an
	王宝安
	(head of SARA)
* Xin Changxing
	信长星
	(vice minister of Human Resources and Social Security)
* Qi Ji 齐骥
	(vice minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development)
* Li Jinzao 李金早
	(vice minister of Commerce)
* Wu Yin 吴吟
	(deputy head of the National Energy Administration)

\*<i>Confirmed
Xinjiang LSG membership at some point between 2002 and 2017</i>



Further, it is
possible that others in the United Front and Politics and Law
hierarchies are part of the Xinjiang LSG, given that their deputies
are. This includes the MPS minister, the head of the CPPCC Committee
for Ethnic and Religious Affairs, and the head of the UFWD. It
remains unclear if one of the LSG deputy head positions definitively
switched from being a vice
premier to being a CPPCC vice chair in 2012, but Liu Yandong
certainly remained active on Xinjiang issues during her recent tenure
as vice premier; Sun Chunlan, as a current vice premier and former
UFWD head, is also a good bet to be involved in Xinjiang
policymaking.

### Regional Leadership: Both Initiator and Instrument

PRC policies related
to Xinjiang became startlingly more repressive in the last two years,
even for a region that was already under more intensive digital and
physical controls than most other areas of China. In particular, two
interrelated efforts have signaled a stepwise increase in security
efforts: the recall and forcible repatriation of ethnic Uyghur and
other predominantly Muslim minority Chinese citizens from abroad, and
the rounding up of those same populations in Xinjiang to put them in
“education and transformation” and “counter-extremism training”
centers.[<sup>8</sup>](#sdendnote8sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote8anc"></a> 


How to explain this
relatively sudden escalation of measures against Uyghur citizens? The
most obvious explanation is the presence of Chen Quanguo, the former
Tibet party secretary who became Xinjiang party secretary in August 2016. Indeed, Chen oversaw the installation of “convenience police
stations” in Tibet, and almost immediately after he arrived in
Xinjiang, the region instituted a similar building spree. These small
police substations, built very near to each other, serve as a way to
increase the density of police presence. Adrian Zenz and James
Leibold have convincingly shown that Chen is almost certainly the
driving force behind these stations as well as the massive increase
in security personnel hiring and overall security spending in the
region.[<sup>9</sup>](#sdendnote9sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote9anc"></a>
And with perhaps only a few exceptions, the timing of the recalls and
repatriations of Chinese citizens abroad—said to have begun in
early 2017—certainly lines up with Chen’s tenure in Xinjiang
(though it is very unlikely that a provincial-level party secretary

These are likely the
early manifestations of a larger shift in policy in Xinjiang. The
shift can be discerned by comparing speeches top leaders gave at the
two Central Xinjiang Work Conferences (中央新疆工作座谈会),
one in 2010 and one in 2014. While the 2014 conference did discuss
the importance of employment, gone was the old-school Communist idea,
explicitly stated in 2010, that “In Xinjiang, like in all of China,
the primary social contradiction is still that between the people’s
increasing material and cultural needs and backwards social
production.” Instead, the 2014 conference had a much stronger
emphasis on ethnic unity and assimilation, on security and
surveillance, and on religion and extremism. Around roughly the same
time, and probably tied to the conference, the Central Committee
issued an “opinion” (意见)
about Xinjiang work, as it had done after the 2010 work conference.
Though the contents of these documents are not publicly available,
the titles alone imply a shift in policy emphasis: “Central
Committee and State Council opinion on promoting Xinjiang’s
leapfrog development and long-term peace and stability”
(中共中央、国务院关于推进新疆跨越式发展和长治久安的意见)
in 2010, versus “Central Committee opinion on further safeguarding
Xinjiang’s social stability and realizing its long-term peace and
stability” (中共中央关于进一步维护新疆社会稳定和实现长治久安的意见)
in 2014.


But even before
this, at the very beginning of 2014, there were hints that
“counter-extremism” would become a watchword for regional policy.
The term *counter-extremism* (去极端化)
received two mentions in the Xinjiang government work report,
delivered at the region’s annual People’s Congress in January.
Two mentions may not seem like much, but the term had not been used
in any reports from 2008 to 2013. (It appeared three times in 2015
and four in 2016, both before Chen became Xinjiang Party Secretary,
and twice each year thereafter.)

Similarly, the
mandated formation of Counter-Extremism Work LSGs at the regional,
prefectural, and county level appeared formally in the “Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region Counter-Extremism Regulations”
(新疆维吾尔自治区去极端化条例),
in effect as of April 2017. Yet this set of regulations was the
result of a two-year-long drafting process, and at least some of its
content was presaged in the “Plan for Deepening and Promoting
‘Counter-Extremism’ Work,” issued by the regional government at
the beginning of 2015, containing similar provisions requiring the
establishment of local Counter-Extremism LSGs.[<sup>10</sup>](#sdendnote10sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote10anc"></a> 
This explains why Yuli County had such an LSG as early as mid-2015.


Which is not to say
that Chen Quanguo has had nothing to do with the intensity of this
latest phase of re-education and counter-extremism “training.”
The reason the centers have become a recent focal point of
international reporting is that they are now overflowing with people,
the scale and scope of the campaign apparently stretching well beyond
its pre-Chen limits. But it’s very difficult to know how much to
attribute directly to Chen, because we have so little insight into
the ethnic minority policy deliberation and formulation process. How
much of these policies come from guidance issued at the 2014 Work
Conference? From the Xinjiang LSG? From recommendations made by
individual government departments, either at the regional or central
level? From individual executive leaders? How much are these entities
working in collaboration to formulate policy, and to what extent are
certain functional hierarchies merely the recipients and implementers
of policies formulated without their input?


The key policy
document that this author found explicitly mandating the use of such
centers was indeed issued in February 2017, after Chen’s arrival,
but as noted above, it likely codifies or expands upon previous
policy efforts.[<sup>11</sup>](#sdendnote11sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote11anc"></a> 
Further, it was issued by the regional Department of Justice (as
befits the government hierarchy responsible for overseeing prisons
and re-education), rather than the regional party committee—though
it remains unclear which lines of policy authority intersected to
produce the more general “training center” policy, let alone this
specific directive. And, of course, the preceding questions assume a
trickle downward of policy directives. In some cases, we know that
policies trickle *upward* after being implemented first in
various localities, such as restrictions on various forms of Islamic
dress.[<sup>12</sup>](#sdendnote12sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote12anc"></a> 
Without more insight into the policy coordination flow, it’s hard
to tell where any specific idea or policy originated, or how
institutional restructuring might affect the existing process going
forward.

Chen is undoubtedly
responsible for some of the significant changes in security and
treatment of ethnic minorities in China—showing that policy
innovation at the sub-national level is, for better and for worse,
still alive in the PRC. The convenience police stations and intensive
hiring of security personnel in Xinjiang bear his imprint. Given the
timing, it’s also quite possible that Chen also lobbied for the
recall and forcible repatriation of Uyghurs abroad. But in other
cases, such as the zealous use of “training centers” in Xinjiang,
he may only be responsible for the last feverish mile of policy
formulation and implementation. Chen’s real policy innovations in
Xinjiang may have come in the form of utilizing existing structures
and priorities to enact exceptionally harsh measures on ethnic
minority residents.
