On November 28, Taiwanese NGO activist Lee Ming-che was [sentenced](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/chinese-court-jails-taiwanese-activist-five-years-subversion-031731509.html) to five years in prison for “subverting state power.” A mainland Chinese citizen, Peng Yuhua, whom Lee’s family says they [had not heard of](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/world/asia/china-sentences-taiwan-rights-activist.html)
 before the trial, was tried with him and sentenced to seven years for
the same crime. This follows Lee’s September trial in Hunan province,
webcast live, during which he confessed to the charges and claimed he
was misled by biased Western media reports about China. Part of the
evidence against Lee included [social media postings](http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-41226326)
 on WeChat, Facebook, and QQ that he wrote while in Taiwan. His case
shows that even non-People’s Republic of China citizens can be [prosecuted](https://sentinel.tw/beware-chinese-social-media/) in mainland courts for their online activity—even when that activity took place outside the mainland.

At the time of Lee’s trial, a [number](https://web.archive.org/web/20170912020909/http://time.com/4935503/taiwan-china-activist-lee-ming-che/) of [articles](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Policy-Politics/Taiwan-activist-pleads-guilty-to-subversion-charges-in-China)
 framed Lee’s detention as directly related to the Foreign NGO Law,
despite the law’s never having been invoked during his prosecution. (Of
course, in any such process, the formal charges may not offer a complete
 description of public security officials’ motivations for detaining
Lee. But the charges that they choose to apply are still relevant.) It
may well be that Lee’s case has had a [chilling effect](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/79701)
 on the Taiwanese NGO community seeking to work in China, particularly
with regard to self-censorship. It is difficult to know how the case has
 or has not affected Taiwanese NGOs’ registration in China, because we
do not have accurate data about how many Taiwanese groups were working
in the mainland prior to the implementation of the Foreign NGO Law.
According to [Ministry of Public Security data](http://ngo.mps.gov.cn/ngo/portal/toInfogs.do?p_type=1),
 nine NGOs from Taiwan have registered a representative office in China
under the new law as of November 27, eight of which were registered
after Lee was detained.

Over the course of Lee’s detention, media coverage and opinion seems
to have coalesced around the notion that this case is more related to
Lee’s “subversive” activities rather than his NGO status per se. But
there are a number of factors about Lee’s case that Chinese authorities
might have zeroed in on as threatening: his Taiwanese identity, his
affiliation with Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party, his status as an
 NGO employee, his online discussions with Chinese activists, or his [provision of banned books](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/78398)
 to people on the mainland. Official opacity in these cases means that
we do not know how each of these factors interacted in the determination
 of the police and the prosecutors to generate the charges against him.

Jerry Cohen and Yu-Jie Chen’s September [assessment](http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/2113665/how-chinas-trial-lee-ming-che-warning-taiwanese-activists) in the South China Morning Post
 clearly drew out the nuances of Lee’s case, describing it first as an
issue of Taiwanese individuals promoting democracy and then secondarily
as a warning to foreign citizens working in China: “&hellip; the case has
sent a loud and clear warning that Taiwanese will be in danger if they
cooperate in “subverting” the Chinese government by promoting freedoms
and democracy, a lifestyle that they take for granted. And not only
Taiwanese. Beijing’s new law regulating foreign NGO activities can also
be applied to prosecute people from other countries.”
