***In advance of the leadership reshuffle this fall, with five of seven Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC) members expected to vacate their seats, observers’ focus is trained on the top candidates for advancement and the intense competition between them.  Yet little is known of any given politician’s personal policy preferences, leaving us unable to estimate how his elevation might influence the development or implementation of domestic policy.  In the absence of such information, this article offers a framework for projecting the policy trends that are likely to continue on no matter who finds his way to the PBSC.***

#### Farewell [Insert Name Here], We Hardly Knew Ye

The
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and observers around the globe are
gearing up for the approaching party congress, an event that promises
to be, like its recent predecessors, both platitudinous and
revealing.  Many people are quite reasonably focused on the drama of
upcoming personnel shuffles, especially given the rather juicy news
that formerly presumptive PBSC member Sun Zhengcai is under
investigation for “serious violations of discipline.”[<sup>1</sup>](#sdendnote1sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote1anc"></a>  Sun’s sudden tumble from the ladder
up to the PBSC has been interpreted as yet another move by Xi Jinping
to consolidate his power in advance of the party congress, buck tacit
leadership promotion norms, and put his own people in place for the
next five years (and beyond, if certain observers’ predictions are
true).[<sup>2</sup>](#sdendnote2sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote2anc"></a> Yet, given the lack of reliable insider information emanating from
Beijing (for better and for worse, Zhongnanhai does not offer up the
free-flow of leaks that the current White House does), it is
difficult at the moment to say why exactly Sun was axed and how it
will affect the composition of the next PBSC.  

Sun’s
downfall does lead to another important question, however: How does
this altered PBSC lineup affect the general policy trajectory of the
CCP, and therefore of China?  Looking specifically at domestic social
policy, how can we determine what the next set of leaders will aim to
accomplish in the cultural, legal, and ideological spheres?

If
recent history is any guide, we are unlikely to learn much by parsing
particular leaders’ résumés for hints of their underlying policy
preferences.  Hu Jintao was seen in many quarters as a potential
“reformer” before he became general secretary, though his
administration’s treatment of dissidents, and its slow and steady
tightening of media and cultural controls, showed that he did not fit
this label as it was intended.[<sup>3</sup>](#sdendnote3sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote3anc"></a> Was Hu a reformer at one time, whose thinking was reshaped over his
years within the system?  Did leading all of China call for a mindset
fundamentally different from that which Hu possessed in his previous
positions in the Communist Youth League, and as party secretary of
Guizhou and Tibet?  Or was the entire notion of his “reformist”
nature something imposed from the outside, a chimera?  We don’t
know.

The
mystery surrounding leaders’ truest thoughts is, of course, by
design.  No government that dispatches functionaries to find and
secure all stray photographs of a politician’s childhood is likely
encourage individual leaders to speak their minds in public.[<sup>4</sup>](#sdendnote4sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote4anc"></a> And while Xi Jinping’s background is more fleshed out (with more
photographs) than Hu’s had been, it is no less tightly controlled
as part of the party’s narrative, and it offers no more real
insight into his personal policy desires than did Hu’s.  Indeed,
before Xi’s administration began in earnest, some speculated that
he might take a gentler line on Tibet (based on the fact that Xi’s
father wore a watch given to him by the Dalai Lama, and the fact that
Xi’s wife is a Buddhist).[<sup>5</sup>](#sdendnote5sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote5anc"></a> Instead, the past few years have seen the government’s merciless
pursuit of Tibetan self-immolators and their families while expanding
the “grid” surveillance system.[<sup>6</sup>](#sdendnote6sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote6anc"></a> International
coverage of leadership turnovers rarely offers up suggestions as to
the specific policy druthers of top leaders, particularly members of
the PBSC (excepting the general
secretary and premier), who seem to be described primarily in terms
of their connections to other senior leaders.[<sup>7</sup>](#sdendnote7sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote7anc"></a>

This
is indeed due in large part to the superlative job the CCP has done
at effacing hints of any given cadre’s individual thoughts and
beliefs.  It also means that, as Kerry Brown recently noted,
English-language discussion of the party congress, and of Chinese
leadership more generally, “focus[es] on personnel, factions, and
human agency, rather than on the more abstract, elusive issues of
what ideas matter, and which are becoming more dominant.”[<sup>8</sup>](#sdendnote8sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote8anc"></a> There are surely both policy-related *and*
personal feuds happening within the walls of Zhongnanhai, and they
are surely intertwined in some cases.  Media coverage tends to focus
on the latter, which—whether the latest gossip is accurate—does
not generally offer insight into policy outcomes.  A focus on the
former might in theory offer more insight, but in the reality of the
tightly controlled PRC media environment, such a focus will
not be brought to bear any time soon.

All
of this is to say that no matter which men (and they are always men)
end up on the red carpet this fall, what little we know of their
personal identities won’t offer us many clues as to their domestic
policy preferences.  If we don’t have a way to tie certain policies
to certain people, is there another means of projecting where China’s
domestic social policies are headed?  If we turn our turn our minds
to the more “abstract, elusive” idea of ideas, what are the
domestic policy through-lines we can expect to see in the next five
years, regardless of who sits on the PBSC?

#### Mystery Men and Policy Priorities

We
are left to divine likely policy choices through the CCP’s past
actions and stated intentions.  Thus, when wading through the mire of
official documents and declarations, it is helpful to have an overall
framework in which to contextualize, for example, the latest effort
to “enrich and develop Socialist art and literature.”[<sup>9</sup>](#sdendnote9sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote9anc"></a> Drawing a blueprint of the party’s underlying motivations allows
us to make educated guesses about the policy-related intentions for
any given edict or bit of legislation—and project what priorities
are likely to remain dominant over time—rather than having to fall
back on purely personal explanations.

An
obvious baseline for this framework is the truism that the CCP’s
deepest motivation is to stay in power.  Taking this as our premise
suggests three follow-on priorities: safeguarding the PRC as an
intact entity to be able to rule over; ensuring that no other centers
of power coalesce to challenge unipolar party supremacy; and
preventing public discontent so widespread that it could upend the
system from below.  

These
basic priorities have not changed much, if at all, in the years since
reform and opening.  What have changed are the conditions, both
internal and external, that must be met to achieve them.  As Emily
Parker recently told the <i>New York
Times</i> in response to the PRC’s
apparent test run of particular censorship capabilities, “It does
appear the [online] crackdown is becoming more intense, but the
internet is also more powerful than it has ever been.  Beijing’s
crackdown on the internet is commensurate with the power of the
internet in China.”[<sup>10</sup>](#sdendnote10sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote10anc"></a>
 Similarly, changes in all aspects of China’s domestic and
international reality demand commensurate changes in policy
response:[<sup>11</sup>](#sdendnote11sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote11anc"></a>
* China in 2017 has had decades of
	ever-increasing contact and interdependence with the rest of the
	world that have altered its citizens’ understanding of themselves
	and their country.  The PRC’s international influence has risen
	significantly, along with its presumption that China’s own
	domestic priorities should be respected even outside its borders.
	The brief time that Donald Trump has been president of the United
	States has likely made China’s claims to a superior model of
	governance even more convincing to its people.
* A growing proportion of China’s citizenry
	possess the heightened expectations of a middle class, and have
	experienced decades of increasing personal freedom.  No longer
	satisfied simply with having enough to eat, these individuals want
	their government to address issues such as degradation and food and
	medicine safety.[<sup>12</sup>](#sdendnote12sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote12anc"></a>
	 Concerns about the rich-poor gap bespeak a more general anxiety
	about the fairness of Chinese society today.
* Growing proportions of the country’s
	population—and its leaders themselves—had no personal experience
	with the founding and forging of the People’s Republic, connoting
	a fundamentally different relationship between the governing and the
	governed.  Traditional cultural value systems were forcibly uprooted
	and replaced with Maoism, but nothing has truly replaced the absence
	of either in the reform era.
* The corruption inherent in any ruling system,
	and particularly in an authoritarian system, has eaten away at the
	underpinnings of popular legitimacy.[<sup>13</sup>](#sdendnote13sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote13anc"></a>
	 Perhaps even more alarmingly, this rot has eroded the willingness
	of local cadres to carry out orders from the center and weakened
	even the top leadership’s commitment to the survival of the CCP
	relative to the fulfillment of personal ambitions.
* Externally, the Color Revolutions of the
	aughts and the Arab Spring in the early 2010s (as well as China’s
	own abortive Jasmine Revolution) served as deafening warnings of the
	collapse that could come if the CCP were too inattentive to its
	population’s needs, too lax in its treatment of nascent political
	threats, or too heedless of what it perceived as foreign meddling.
* All this has of course taken place alongside
	the creeping penetration of internet technology into all corners of
	political and social life.
A
number of these factors have both positive and negative aspects from
the party’s perspective.  For example, younger generations may not
personally remember events that the CCP would rather erase from its
history, such as the Great Leap Forward or the protests in Tiananmen
Square, making it easier to maintain official control over public
discussion and understanding of these events.  At the same time,
these young people also lack a personal memory of a much poorer
China, meaning their frame of reference for material and personal
success is based on the increasing wealth they see around them rather
than a hardscrabble past—raising expectations about their
livelihoods and lifestyles in ways that are more complicated for the
government to fulfill.  (This sense of relative deprivation also
helps us when considering terms such as *loser*
(屌丝)
and<i>
white-rich-beautiful/tall-rich-handsome </i>(白富美/高富帅)
that have become popular in recent years as young people define
themselves by and against current standards of wealth and success
rather than seeing themselves as wildly successful compared to their
parents’ or grandparents’ generation.)[<sup>14</sup>](#sdendnote14sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote14anc"></a>

Though
they certainly do not serve as a crystal ball, this set of needs and
conditions can be helpful in making educated guesses about where
domestic Chinese policy is likely to go. For example, absent any
other reliable information, the motivations and conditions described
above signal that that the anti-corruption campaign has roots deeper
than Xi’s shallow desire for self-aggrandizement and personal
power.  (It does not, of course, preclude Xi having such desires.)
Rather than predicting that the anti-corruption campaign would die
down once the initial waves had convulsed through the system and Xi
felt reassured that his position was stable, this set of conditions
would have suggested something more akin to the long-lived campaign
we’re currently seeing.

So
what are the domestic policy through-lines we can expect to continue
given this set of needs and the array of specific conditions under
which they must be met?[<sup>15</sup>](#sdendnote15sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote15anc"></a>

***Party
loyalty and discipline at the center, rather than the fringes, of
domestic policy planning.***
 Unless one is absolutely convinced that the only purpose of the
anti-corruption campaign is the continued purging of Xi Jinping’s
enemies, there is no reason to think that party discipline efforts
will flag significantly in his second term.  Within the
constraints it has placed on itself—including
reliance on a watchdog entity that is embedded in the structure it is
supposed to police—the CCP seems determined to root out as many
disloyal and corrupt cadres as possible.  This effort underpins all
others. Without a governing corps that has some measure of legitimacy
among those it governs, that more or less faithfully implements the
policies envisioned at the top, and that accepts the party’s
strictures on public politicking, none of the other policy priorities
have much hope of succeeding.

***Sincere
and focused (if not always successful) efforts to recognize and
ameliorate the middle class’s most pressing concerns.***
If the CCP hopes to continue thwarting the rise of alternative
sources of legitimacy and the diffusion of regime-threatening
discontent, it has to deliver the goods as an adequately responsive
government.  This is most critical in relation to those citizens with
the highest potential to destabilize the foundations of the regime:
otherwise apolitical beneficiaries of China’s economic success who
nonetheless could form a credible threat if mobilized en masse.  This
can be seen in, among other examples, the increased pace and amount
of regulations relating to environmental protection in recent years,
as well as efforts such as the China Food Product Rumor-Refuting
Alliance.[<sup>16</sup>](#sdendnote16sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote16anc"></a>
 It is also evident in Beijing’s push to be a “Rule of Law
Country”: the party-state must be seen as creating and (more or
less) abiding by a fair set of rules if it hopes to retain popular
buy-in to its permanent rule.[<sup>17</sup>](#sdendnote17sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote17anc"></a>

***Brutal,
reflexive suppression of anyone found testing the boundaries of the
politically possible, even in seemingly “safe” ways.***
This means that those individuals or groups who are aligned with
party aims—anti-corruption, or environmental protection, say—cannot
advocate for these causes if it even indirectly challenges the system
in which they operate.  This is the corollary of the previous point:
the CCP may be working to improve Chinese citizens’ lives,
including allowing much more personal freedom than had been
imaginable 40 years ago, but it must also be the sole entity enacting
or legitimizing changes to social policies and systems.  One might
imagine the post–reform-and-opening CCP as changing its fundamental
citizen-management strategy from a “stay inside the fence”
approach (in which citizens could go wherever they wanted within the
sociopolitical walls the party-state had erected) to a “keep off
the grass” approach (in which citizens can go almost anywhere they
want, save a specific walled-off area).  To make this approach
effective and indeed keep citizens off the grass, the penalties must
be credibly harsh.  Even if the vast majority of the population has
no interest in this forbidden zone, those who do must know that even
gentle challenges to certain aspects of the regime can engender a
crushing response.  We have certainly seen this crushing response
both in its targets (Liu Xiaobo and the “709 Lawyers,” to name
only the most prominent cases) and in its methods (e.g., televised
confessions).[<sup>18</sup>](#sdendnote18sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote18anc"></a>

***Selective
and somewhat awkward efforts to channel or even stanch the flow of
international intercourse.***  This
barrier, of course, cannot be absolute, for both practical and
theoretical reasons.  Presuming that China could not and would not
want to become a larger version of North Korea, it cannot cut its
population off from the world in a comprehensive way.  It must also
not cause too much anger among a population that is used to watching
*The Big Bang Theory*
and taking vacations to Europe.  Yet it is difficult to ignore the
preponderance of evidence that the PRC is increasingly willing to
accept very real political and economic costs in order to keep a
tighter grip on the foreign influences that are reaching its shores.
The Foreign NGO Law, recent regulations on VPN use, and the
Cybersecurity Law are all manifestations of this trend.[<sup>19</sup>](#sdendnote19sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote19anc"></a>

***The
active development of a positive definition of “China,”***
as a center of gravity for citizens’ notions of what it means to be
Chinese and as inoculation against inevitable encounters with
competing theories of governance.  This vision is “positive” in
the sense that it is meant to fill a void, a “negative,” created
after decades of the party-state disfavoring or even eradicating
traditional cultural and political norms.  The CCP is attempting to
define modern Chinese identity that goes beyond the callow “to get
rich is glorious.”  This can be seen in a hodgepodge of government
efforts to direct the development of culture (itself a strange
construction), the revival of Confucianism, and in the promotion of
“core socialist values.”[<sup>20</sup>](#sdendnote20sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote20anc"></a>
 Of course, there is a component of this effort that involves
questioning the validity of other countries’ models or lack
thereof—embodied by the cartoon contrasting U.S., British, and
Chinese leadership selection systems—but the creation of a
meaningful sense of what China *is*
is essential to the modern Chinese governance project.[<sup>21</sup>](#sdendnote21sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote21anc"></a><br/>

***Tireless
efforts to assert greater control over all manner of media and
communication tools.***  This is also a
prerequisite to many of the other agenda items.  The party cannot
hope to effectively manage foreign contact, expunge dissonant
messages, or promote its own narrative without dominating all media
for communication.  There are a number of obvious components to this,
like not allowing social media to be used as an organizational tool
for open revolt, a la Arab Spring, or reining in virtual private
networks to suppress foreign or otherwise subversive content.  But an
important purpose to the party’s constant patrolling of cyberspace
is also to prevent the emergence of alternate sources of legitimacy,
centers of popular power that could potentially undermine the CCP.
This was likely a major component of the drive to silence “Big V’s”
on Sina Weibo back in 2013.[<sup>22</sup>](#sdendnote22sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote22anc"></a>

#### Governing in the Land of the High-Hanging Fruit

The
agenda laid out in Hu Jintao’s report to the 18th Party Congress,
which has provided the template for the efforts outlined above, was
that of a government trying to wrap its hands around an increasingly
complex and difficult set of domestic policy choices.[<sup>23</sup>](#sdendnote23sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote23anc"></a>
 During the first few decades of reform and opening, the party-state
oversaw tremendous growth in part by allowing the Chinese economy and
society to refoliate themselves after being stunted during the Mao
era.  By 2012, it was clear that this approach was no longer enough:
all the low-hanging policy fruit had been plucked.  In working toward
its goal of “building a moderately prosperous society” by 2020,
the CCP has made a great contribution to the world in terms of
poverty alleviation, but this progress comes with a new set of
challenges simply because more and more Chinese now have something to
lose when any given policy choice doesn’t go their way. Many of the
decisions that the party must make now are fraught with unpleasant
trade-offs that can spark public discontent.  A recent protest in
Shanghai is a case in point: in an attempt to dampen property
speculation, the city issued measures restricting the use of
commercially-zoned property for residential purposes.  After
demonstrators took to the street to voice their opposition, the city
partially relented by allowing buyers of such “dual-use”
properties to move in to their homes.<sup>[<sup>24</sup>](#sdendnote24sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote24anc"></a>

Despite
the dangers inherent in the challenges facing the CCP—and public
expressions of discontent with its decisions—it is important to
remember that most Chinese say they are happy with the way things are
going in China.[<sup>25</sup>](#sdendnote25sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote25anc"></a>
 If the party can maintain this general level of public satisfaction
while navigating the difficult policy choices that lie ahead, it will
be doing quite well for itself.  Outside observers often focus on the
portion of the population that is unhappy with the regime’s
policies (and rightfully so, given that some of these individuals are
unable to freely express their discontent at home).  Yet the
party-state does not need to satisfy everyone in order to maintain
its place in Zhongnanhai.  Though the mechanisms for a change in
ruling party are, by design, much more dramatic in China than in
democratic nations, the governing strategy can essentially be boiled
down to the same thing: the CCP just needs to keep *enough*
of the people happy *enough*
of the time.

[<sup>11</sup>](#sdendnote11anc)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote11sym"></a> Careful readers will notice that ethnic minority issues,
	particularly those in Tibet and Xinjiang, are not addressed in this
	article.  This is because the CCP largely views these issues as
	separate from—and requiring much harsher responses than—those
	related to the majority Han population.  Giving this topic its due
	requires more than a brief bullet and paragraph in this context.

[<sup>15</sup>](#sdendnote15anc)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote15sym"></a> To reiterate, this author does not mean to suggest that such a
	“model” can predict with perfect accuracy what the CCP might do,
	nor to suggest that additional reliable information about any one
	leader’s policy preferences or power would not alter such a
	prediction.  Instead, this framing of the CCP’s values and
	motivations is meant to function as a tool to use in the absence of
	other reliable information.  It also contains the implicit
	assumption that policy-making in China is not solely based on
	factions but does also wrestle with policy ideas.
