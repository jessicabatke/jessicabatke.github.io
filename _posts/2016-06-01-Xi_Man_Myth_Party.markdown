#### Key Findings:
* Xi
	Jinping is not the sole or even primary factor causing recent major
	shifts in the Chinese political landscape. Structural and
	situational factors also explain many of these changes.
* In
	fact, the policies Xi is pursuing are largely in line with the
	Party’s previously-articulated agenda. His apparent increase in
	decision-making power—though far from certain in all cases—is in
	part the result of collective sense of urgency at the highest levels
	prior to the leadership turnover.<br/>
* Xi’s
	“cult of personality” is a far cry from the fervour of the cult
	of Mao. Media coverage of Xi Jinping should be viewed in the context
	of a highly professional and deliberate leadership personality
	management system that serves the CCP’s modern propaganda needs.
* When
	assessing the future trajectory of the Chinese political system, we
	would be well-served to focus on the success or failure of the CCP’s
	policy agenda and not just on the man heading it. Indeed, a
	spectacular failure could threaten the existence of the entire
	regime.


The last few years have seen dramatic
changes in the Chinese political landscape that raise significant
questions about where China is headed.  The Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) has revitalized Leninist party governance mechanisms and
forcefully reasserted control over members of the government,
military, media, economy, and society.  Many observers attribute the
Party’s dramatic resurgence to the face of this effort: General
Secretary Xi Jinping.  This assumption is the foundation for several
pieces of conventional wisdom, which present Xi himself as the
primary driver of change in China and focus on his actions as the
best way to analyse China’s future.  <br/>


This narrative may turn out to be the
closest to the truth. However, given the opacity of the Chinese
system, forcing us to frequently rely on information that is
anecdotal or shaped by the PRC propaganda apparatus, this narrative
may miss key elements of China’s political landscape. Indeed, if Xi
is viewed as a creature of his Party and of his times, who assumed
his mantle with a mandate for a particular vision of reform and a
broad recognition that strong, revitalized central leadership was
required to carry it out, alternative narratives may be crucial to
understanding decision making within China have important
implications for China and foreign observers.


This
paper will provide a larger context for Xi’s actions and posit
that, even as major changes have occurred in China’s political
landscape, available evidence does not rule out alternative
narratives.  This paper is not meant to argue for an all-or-nothing
interpretation of Xi Jinping’s personal power, or to deny that
individual leaders can determine a nation’s trajectory in crucial
ways.   However, by reviewing the dominant narrative frameworks and
discussing additional structural and situational factors driving
Chinese policy, this paper aims to highlight what is missing from
much of the conventional wisdom and present a preliminary alternative
framework for thinking about the future of Chinese politics.  



#### Conventional Wisdom 1 – Xi’s personal agenda has defined China’s policy strategy


The Xi administration started in on its
anti-corruption campaign almost immediately after the leadership
turnover, sending shock waves throughout the governance system.
Combined with a more tightly-controlled media and social sphere, the
resulting alterations to Chinese political life are undeniable.  Many
observers point to Xi as the sole or primary driver of these
alternations.  However, Xi benefited from a collective sense of
urgency about the challenges facing the Party and a mandate for
reform to tackle these challenges.


Years before the most recent leadership
transition, the CCP began to systematically analyse the pressures
leading to the collapse of the USSR and identifying changes it would
have to make to avoid the same fate.  By late-2012, the pressures the
CCP faced ranged from economic (the deficiencies of an export- and
investment-intensive growth model had been exacerbated by the 2008
stimulus in response to the global financial crisis) to social
(growing middle-class dissatisfaction with quality-of-life issues
such as pollution and food safety),<sup></sup>to technological and
ideological (the advent of social media amplifying non-Party
messages, raising the spectre of popular revolt), and to
institutional (the CCP’s internal rot threatening to undermine
Party functioning and legitimacy).   This final issue was
dramatically underscored by the 2012 public revelation of Chongqing
Party Secretary Bo Xilai’s crimes—the most serious of which, if
officially unmentioned, was his attempt to circumvent leadership
selection processes.  The new leadership had little choice but to act
quickly and aggressively in order to preserve CCP rule, giving Xi a
mandate to tackle these challenges in a manner more decisive than his
predecessors.


Xi likely personally shared this sense of
crisis and urgency. Certainly, as
part of the previous leadership cohort, he had a hand in shaping the
current policy agenda aimed at these challenges.  Anecdotal tales
about Xi’s formative years or quotes from recent speeches suggest
that he sincerely believes in the Party’s historic mission to
rejuvenate the nation.  But whatever Xi’s beliefs, his policy
behaviour since taking power remains consistent with the policy
strategies outlined by the outgoing leadership.  The 18<sup>th</sup>
Party Congress work report, written under Hu’s leadership and built
upon familiar policy themes from previous Congresses, articulated the
Party’s consensus goals and policy preferences and presented Xi and
his colleagues with a mandate for reform.  



This even includes
the signature initiative of the Xi administration, the
anti-corruption campaign, which is the initiative that appears to
diverge most strikingly from leadership precedent. Many observers
initially interpreted the campaign as Xi Jinping’s attempt to
consolidate power and
eliminate personal or political enemies.  Yet, the campaign itself
has proven to be long-lasting, expansive in scope, and increasingly
systematic in the sectors it investigates, affecting tens of
thousands of officials with no connection to Xi or his associates.
When
considered alongside other initiatives (such as the
State Council’s “powers list,” which aims to clarify government
agencies’ powers and prevent arbitrary fees and bribes), the
Party’s anti-corruption efforts strongly suggest an organization
trying to clean out the worst of its corruption and remove
obstructions to further governance reform, in accordance with
long-standing Party priorities.  This does not preclude personal
score-settling or benefits for Xi, but it is very difficult to
explain the campaign as driven purely by elite politics.




Thus, given that policy under Xi has not
wildly deviated from previously-articulated Party strategies and
objectives, the most straightforward assumption holds that the
current leadership’s policy priorities reflect broader agreement
how to address threats to Party rule.  Xi himself likely shares these
priorities, but available evidence does not prove they are solely
his.  This also does not rule out the existence of disagreements
among top leaders, including personality-driven conflicts.  But the
contours of these conflicts remain largely hidden to us, and it is
difficult to prove how exactly they have shaped the Party’s
actions. (Miller 2015)


#### Conventional Wisdom 2 – Xi is concentrating power to his person and to be wielded in dictatorial fashion


Many observers assert that Xi has drawn the
reins of power tightly to himself through, among other efforts, the
creation or expansion of high-level Party policy structures.  Xi may
indeed have more decision-making leeway than his predecessor.  Yet,
some of this concentration of authority is due to several key
top-level structural changes initiated under the previous leadership
to allow for more decisive action, suggesting a mandate for
centralization in service of the aforementioned Party priorities.
Additionally, the creation of new structures, in and of itself, is
not adequate as diagnostic evidence of Xi’s personal power.


At the very highest level, Xi benefits from
structural changes enacted or approved by the previous leadership
cohort.  He heads a slimmed-down Politburo Standing Committee, likely
designed for quicker, more focused decision-making after the apparent
policy stagnation during Hu Jintao’s second term.   Xi gained
further political space as Hu stepped down from all three top
leadership positions (in contrast to Hu’s predecessor Jiang Zemin,
who retained his position as head of the Central Military Commission
for two years after stepping down as General Secretary).  Xi
also inherited Central Committee staff, responsible chiefly to him,
which had been enlarged and empowered under Hu. (Heath 2015)




The creation of new leading small groups
(LSGs), several of which Xi heads, is often cited as evidence of Xi
seizing power for himself.  This claim rests on several assumptions,
the first of which is that heading a group definitively confers
additional power on the man already holding all top central
leadership posts and disregards other bureaucratic players.  LSGs,
long an influential part of the PRC policy-making process,
deliberately include representatives from other relevant Party and
state institutions, including other Politburo Standing Committee
(PBSC) members.  So does the creation of new LSGs represent an
end-run around other policy-making institutions, even if those
institutions are represented in the new LSGs?  Do they equal a
zero-sum expansion of Xi’s influence, or can they bring additional
expert voices into the policy discussion?  If the new LSGs also
contain relevant PBSC members, does Xi gain additional power from
heading a policy discussion in an LSG venue rather than at the PBSC?


Further, what does it mean, on a day-to-day
basis, to chair multiple LSGs in addition to running a nation of 1.4
billion?  Given the other demands for his time, a significant portion
of these groups’ work is likely handled by the groups’ other
members and their supporting bureaucracies.  Xi certainly personally
influences a group’s activities when he is directly involved—and,
according to anecdotes, may be inclined to micromanage—but there
must be a limit to how much micromanaging one man can do. The new
LSGs also have more deputy heads than previously-existing ones, which
suggests the complexity of the tasks undertaken as well as the
involvement, if not empowerment, of other leaders in the Party’s
policy endeavours.  Even if heading more groups does directly equate
to more power, it remains unclear exactly how many groups Xi heads.
(Wang Shu 2015)  If he heads more leading small groups than Hu Jintao
did, it is still a minority of more than 20 publicly-acknowledged
LSGs.  And while the Xi administration has been more transparent
about current LSGs, we still don’t know much more about how they
operated under Hu.


How much of the recent structural changes
are due to the CCP’s reform plans and how much of it is due to Xi’s
personal quest for power?  Both structural and personal factors are
likely in play here, but at least some centralization was initiated
before Xi took the helm as a prerequisite for the
implementation of long-standing Party priorities.
It is also unclear how much some more recent structural changes are
affecting personal power concentration.  



#### Conventional Wisdom 3 – Xi is building a cult of personality


Chinese media coverage of Xi Jinping shows
a bolder, more charismatic leader than did coverage of Hu Jintao.
Observers commonly cite this apparently more personalized media
treatment as evidence of Xi Jinping’s desire to build a cult of
personality.  



Yet, the change in coverage also aligns
with several CCP goals. First among these is to re-establish the
faded CCP brand and reinvigorate positive popular sentiment toward
the Party. (Ci Jiwei 2014) Modifying leadership media treatment to
focus more on the top leader supports this effort, inasmuch as it
gives the Party a centre of gravity in the form of a strong,
trustworthy, personally-relatable leader. This rebranding effort is
also evident in the push for “new official-speak” (initiated in
the last years of the Hu administration) and in the frequent release
of cartoons and songs that aim to reach a younger audience on digital
platforms. From this perspective, the CCP’s glossier treatment of
Xi Jinping looks very much like a Leninist propaganda system trying
to drag itself into the modern media and social environment.<b>
</b>Other changes may be the result
of personality, but not necessarily indicative of a personality cult.
Certainly in comparison to his “wooden” predecessor, the CCP’s
propaganda apparatus has more raw material to work with in General
Secretary Xi Jinping.



It is notable that, since taking up China’s
top leadership spot, Xi Jinping is not known for going off-script in
his public appearances, as Jiang Zemin sometimes memorably did. The
near-total adherence to a script raises questions about how much of
his public persona is attributable to him and how much is created in
concert with his propaganda team. Of course, none of this excludes
the possibility that Xi Jinping is seeking personal adulation. Yet it
bears remembering that the Party’s propaganda mechanisms are
responding to changes other than just Xi’s relative power within
the leadership structure. Indeed, media coverage of Xi Jinping should
be viewed in the context of a highly professional and deliberate
leadership personality management system, reducing our ability to
infer too much about the man based on his media image.  



#### A Creature of an Embattled System


Analysis of Xi Jinping’s personal power
is most significant not as an end in itself, but rather as a way for
us to gauge where the Chinese political system is headed.  And the
Chinese political system, as embodied by the CCP and Xi Jinping, is
currently fighting for its own survival.  Xi inherited the Party’s
prescribed course of action for this struggle: a combination of
economic and governance reforms that ensure adequate public service
provision and transition the economy to a new growth model, alongside
political initiatives that enhance Party discipline and stifle
extra-Party voices.  Whether or not this strategy will work depends
partly on the Xi administration’s ability to execute it, but more
so whether the strategy itself is inherently sufficient to save the
regime.



In our quest to understand the future of
the Chinese political system, then, we would be well-served to focus
on the viability this strategy and not only on the man currently
heading it. If the CCP has judged correctly, the public will remain
acceptably quiescent, the Party tolerably coherent as an
organization, and the economy strong enough to keep chugging along.
In this case, the Party may well deem the current mode of leadership
a success and seek to replicate it. Alternatively, the strategy
itself might prove to be the wrong solution to the Party’s
problems, or get executed so poorly that it does not function as
intended. Likewise, the CCP might have miscalculated its ability to
impose its vision on lower-level cadres, many of whom resent its
effects on their interests. Xi, as the face of the agenda, would be a
likely target of public ire—though in such a situation, a
leadership reshuffle would be the least of Party concerns. Indeed, a
spectacular failure could threaten the existence of the entire
regime.  



Of course, Xi could upend this calculus by
overstepping his mandate. Were we to begin to see a series of policy
directives that contravene the general policy line, we could infer
that they were the result of an individual’s personal whim or the
makings of a very high-level opposition group within the Party. That
would be a dangerous moment for Party unity and survival, and could
also portend momentous change for Chinese politics, if not the state.
