***Beijing’s update of national-level religious regulations is part and parcel of a larger governance effort. This effort is designed to construct a latticework of legislation for managing citizens’ activities and minimizing international influences. If these regulations are implemented uniformly—which is always a big if in the PRC—in some cases they will offer greater certainty about what is allowed under the law. In others, they will restrict activities that previously had not been clearly regulated. Beijing’s negotiations with the Vatican over bishop ordinations reflect the same desires: to cement the party’s role in defining the permissible in Chinese religious life, to check foreign influence, and to continue to regularize social-management efforts.***

#### A Long-Awaited Work Conference Finally Held

In April 2016,
General Secretary Xi Jinping chaired a National Religious Work
Conference (全国宗教工作会议),
possibly the first time a general secretary attended such a meeting
since Jiang Zemin did so in 2001.[<sup>1</sup>](#sdendnote1sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote1anc"></a>
 The conference was rumored to have been postponed several times due
to Xi’s purported dissatisfaction with the general direction of
religious policy.  Whatever the reason for the delay, coverage of the
conference in authoritative party media—and follow-on articles from
Wang Zuo’an, head of the State Administration for Religious Affairs
(SARA)—made clear that a key goal of the conference was to reassert
the CCP’s “guiding” role in religious affairs.[<sup>2</sup>](#sdendnote2sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote2anc"></a>
 The conference followed a series of speeches and high-level visits
touching on the issues of religion in 2015, including several by
Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference head Yu
Zhengsheng.[<sup>3</sup>](#sdendnote3sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote3anc"></a>

Xi’s speech at the
conference was not a great departure from the CCP’s religious
policy as it has been enacted in the last few decades, but it did
highlight several themes that have become more prominent in recent
years under Xi.[<sup>4</sup>](#sdendnote4sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote4anc"></a>
 This included the need to “sinicize” (中国化)
religion, making it suit Chinese society and serve the best interests
of the country, while urging religious believers to throw themselves
into the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.  It also
emphasized managing religion under the rule of law.

The speech also
restated several core tenets of the CCP’s religious management
since reform and opening.  Wang’s articles explain that the concept
of “guiding” (导)
religion, a key theme of Xi’s speech, is explicitly meant to walk
the line between loosening up (放)
and tightening up (收),
neither allowing religion to go unchecked and vulnerable to the
nefarious machinations of “external forces” nor attempting to
snuff out religion completely.  The speech affirmed the party’s
duty to continue regulating religious activity with an eye to larger
national and social interests (read: not allowing individuals’
religious rights to impinge upon party authority) and maintaining a
firm separation between church and state (read: not allowing party
members to ascribe to any religion).

Essentially, just as
it is trying to do with social service–oriented nonprofits, the CCP
hopes to harness aspects of religious belief that “help social
harmony, modernization, [and a] healthy civilization”[<sup>5</sup>](#sdendnote5sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote5anc"></a>
while criminalizing aspects it finds threatening or unhelpful.  The
CCP knows it cannot eradicate religion entirely—this notion was one
of the major tenets of Document 19, which was issued in 1982 and
still forms the basis of the party’s religious policy.  This means
the party must find ways to regulate religious practice without
causing regime-threatening discontent, and it must now do so in an
increasingly complex domestic and foreign environment.  In his
speech, Xi named several challenges that this “new situation”
(新形势)
presents the party with regard to its religious management: external
forces’ infiltration into China; the spread of extremist thought;
and, aiding and abetting the previous two, the ubiquity of the
Internet.

#### New Regulations for the “New Situation”

These overarching
concerns are also apparent in the new language and provisions
included in the 2016 draft update to SARA’s Religious Affairs
Regulations.  The updated regulations, posted for public comment in
September, maintain many of the same provisions of the 2005 version.
A number of the draft provisions, however, reflect the CCP’s
concern over the “new situation” specifically.  Particularly
troubling for the CCP is the widespread use of the Internet and the
concomitant weakening of government control over information flows.
Though one would expect that a 2016 update to a decade-old regulatory
document would include more mentions of the Internet (the terms for
*Internet* [互联网]
and *website *[网点]
appear seven times in the 2016 draft regulations versus one mention
of *website* in the older version), it is very likely that the
increase also reflects the governments’ heightened concern over the
Internet’s ability to spread unsanctioned religious material.
Other changes are clearly designed to create regulatory structures
for areas that previously were, in Beijing’s view, underregulated.
This is particularly evident in the new section addressing religious
schools, which describes application, approval, verification, and
reporting processes for religious training institutions.  These
schooling-related regulations are likely meant at least in part to
further foreclose any possibility of external influence (such as the
pope or the Dalai Lama) over the next generation of the faithful.

Comparing the 2005
Religious Work Regulations[<sup>6</sup>](#sdendnote6sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote6anc"></a>
with the latest draft of the updated regulations,[<sup>7</sup>](#sdendnote7sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote7anc"></a>
many of the additions and alterations fit into a few overarching
themes, some of which are covered below.

#### “Rule of law” and More Specific Rules

Reflecting the CCP’s
overall concern with establishing a “rule of law” (法治)
that gives citizens the sense their government is fair and
legitimate, the new regulations contain much of the same terminology
that is increasingly prevalent in government writing and propaganda.
Simply comparing the frequency of certain terms in the old versus new
regulations is revealing: *legal* (合法)
appears 13 times in the new regulations and nine times in the old;
*illegal* (非法)
appears 14 times in the new regulations and twice in the old; and
*according to the law* (依法)
appears 37 times in the new regulations and 22 times in the old.
This legalistic push also means that the regulations offer greater
specificity and clarity on the range of permissible and impermissible
religious behavior.  Among the other clarifications they offer, the
new regulations define the functions and roles of religious groups;
offer greater detail about asset management, venue construction, and
religious schooling; and outline specific monetary fines in case of
violations.  

In some cases, the
emphasis on rules applies not only to religious elements in society
but to government organs as well.  For example, a new feature of the
updated regulations is the provision that relevant authorities must
provide a reason in writing when they refuse an application to
establish a religious school or hold a religious activity.

***Role of Public Security:*** The new draft
regulations state explicitly what went unstated in the older version:
that public security organs, as represented by the Ministry of Public
Security (MPS) are responsible for dealing with illegal religious
activity, while SARA maintains responsibility for managing legal
religious activity.  The new regulations also incorporate the notion
that religious management units should consult with public security
when dealing with certain unapproved religious activities or events.
The term *public security* <br/>
(公安)
is used 10 times in the new regulations but was never used in the old
regulations.

***Fear of the Foreign:*** Religious groups’
connections with the outside world have always been a particular
concern of the CCP, hence the formation of “patriotic” religious
associations in China designed to preempt domestic believers’ close
connections with foreign religious groups.  This notion is amped up
slightly in the new regulations, starting with Article 3, which,
among its other guiding principles, says that religious management
work in China must “resist infiltration.”  National security
(国家安全)
is cited three times in the new regulations versus one time in the
old; “the principles of independence, autonomy, and
self-management” (独立自主自办原则),
a set phrase which seems quite redundant in English, is used five
times in the new regulations versus three times in the old; and the
term *foreign forces* (境外势力
or 外国势力)
appears two times in the new regulations, versus none in the old.

***Importance of Subnational Government:*** The new regulations
emphasize local organs’ role in implementing religious policy,
stating that “all levels of the people’s government should
strengthen their leadership over religious work, establish robust
religious work mechanisms, and ensure the strength of and necessary
conditions for religious work” (各级人民政府应当加强对宗教工作的领导,
建立健全宗教工作机制,
保障宗教工作力量和必要的工作条件).
 The regulations also name village and residential committees as
responsible for assisting the government in religious work.  Xi
Jinping’s speech at the April Religious Affairs Work Conference
also stressed the role of subnational government in religious
management and stated that party theory and policy related to
religious issues should be incorporated into cadres’ training
plans.  This focus on subnational government likely reflects
Beijing’s more general desire to enforce local-level compliance
with central directives and promote uniform implementation of
national rules and regulations.

Of course, Beijing’s
idealized version of religious management, as outlined in these
documents, is unlikely to play out perfectly in real life.  The fact
that government organs are supposed to provide written explanations
when they refuse certain applications, for example, does not mean
that they will necessarily do so, or that the rationale provided will
itself accord with the letter or spirit of Chinese laws and
regulations.  Nonetheless, the intentions of the Chinese leadership
are noteworthy in and of themselves.  We will have to wait and see
how these intentions are translated into reality—both in the final
version of the regulations, and in their implementation at the lower
levels.<br/>

Though most
religion-specific regulations are addressed in separate regulatory
documents, some language in the new draft Religious Affairs
Regulations does appear to be aimed at particular religions.  The
increased mentions of *terror* (恐怖),
*extreme/ extremist* (极端),
and *ethnicity* (民族)—usually
in a context of stemming terrorist activity or criminalizing ethnic
separatism—are almost certainly in reference to China’s ethnic
Uyghur Muslims.  There are also a number of provisions discussing the
need for construction of religious venues to accord with larger
city-planning goals and outlining the procedure for erecting “outdoor
religious statues,” likely referring to the many Christian churches
and crosses in Zhejiang Province that have been torn down in recent
years.

#### Greater Clarity, For Better and For Worse

As noted above, much
of what comes out of the April work conference and the new draft
legislation are extensions of the religious policies Beijing has
favored for the past few decades.  As much as it might like to do so,
the CCP is aware that forcibly attempting to eradicate religion is
counterproductive.  This has led to the current strategy, which still
holds that religion will die out eventually, but in the meantime must
be appropriately regulated to keep it from metastasizing into a
direct threat to the regime.  This strategy has produced a series of
detailed regulatory documents over the last decade, including
measures on managing, registering, and approving religious “activity
sites,” religious personnel such as living Tibetan Buddhas and
Catholic bishops, and religious charity activities.[<sup>8</sup>](#sdendnote8sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote8anc"></a>
 It should come as no surprise, then, that updates to the overarching
Religious Affairs Regulations offer a more detailed, legalistic
framework for general religious management.

These growing
efforts to more precisely regulate religious behavior fit neatly into
a larger pattern of formalizing and professionalizing the
policymaking and implementation process.  Transforming itself from a
“revolutionary” to a “governing” party, the CCP has erected a
latticework of legislation and regulation addressing
ever-more-complex governance challenges.[<sup>9</sup>](#sdendnote9sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote9anc"></a>
 Beyond the draft religious regulations, Beijing’s prescriptions
for state-society relations and the bounds of acceptable social
behavior are implicitly part of a raft of recent laws, including the
National Security Law, the Counterterrorism Law, the Charity Law, and
the Foreign NGO Law.

This legal
framework, even if it enshrines human rights restrictions unpopular
among Western observers, is not all negative for average Chinese
citizens.  Though it does serve to cement CCP control over religious
activities, it also offers greater predictability and certainty for
those wishing to avoid conflict with the government.  The
regulations’ increased specificity means that there is a clearer
framework for religious groups who want to operate within the letter
of the law.  (Observers have suggested that this legal clarity may
also be a benefit of the new Charity Law, enacted in 2015.)

Of course, there
will also be those who lose out under a more rigorous management
system.  All manner of religious activities in China have taken place
in a nebulous, legally undefined gray zone, and the imposition of
definitions necessarily means that some people and organizations will
find themselves on the wrong side of the line.  And it may not always
be the usual suspects—the poor, the rural, the
less-well-connected—who are most affected.  The church demolitions
in Zhejiang Province over the last few years may well be a harbinger
of how Beijing hopes to enforce compliance among communities whose
wealth or connections had insulated them from the rules as they
existed elsewhere.  Thus far, Beijing does not appear to be using the
Zhejiang demolitions as a pilot project for a nationwide campaign
against Christianity more generally.  Instead, the demolitions likely
represent an early effort by the Xi administration to make clear that
religion is subservient to the CCP and that no believers are exempt
from the CCP’s restrictions.

The work conference
and the draft regulations affirm the notion that the party must draw
clear boundaries around its citizens’ religious behavior and that
these boundaries must be enforced at all levels.  They also suggest,
however, that relatively predictable, uniform management of religion
is also important if the party wants to avoid needlessly antagonizing
believers.  The CCP recognizes that religion can be a positive force
in society, as long as it serves to underpin the party’s goals, and
by extension, the party’s rule itself.  Naturally, the party is the
one that decides what constitutes such support.  “The theory of
religion under socialism with Chinese characteristics”
(中国特色社会主义宗教理论)
is a part of the CCP’s larger vision for reasserting its exclusive
right to define the permissible in social behavior.  Compared to 40
or 50 years ago, a wide variety of behaviors and personal freedoms
are indeed permissible.  But the CCP wants to ensure that it is still
the ultimate arbiter of the permissible.

#### The Pope: The Ultimate Foreign Menace?

Beijing’s efforts
toward more precisely defining and managing religion also extend to
reestablishing relations with the Vatican, with which it is
reportedly in talks to broker a deal on the ordination of bishops in
China.  It may seem counterintuitive that an administration so
obsessed with minimizing foreign influences on its population would
be open to negotiating an agreement on bishop ordination with the
pope.  But such negotiations reflect the CCP’s desire to have it
both ways: it would like to work through a regularized ordination
process that promotes grassroots buy-in to the legitimacy of the
state-affiliated Catholic church while at the same time ensuring that
the party doesn’t cede control over key personnel decisions to a
foreign entity.  Overtures by Pope Francis himself, who took up his
position in March 2013, seem to have played a critical role in
creating space for such talks to occur.

Sino-Vatican
relations have been particularly strained since 2010, when the
state-affiliated Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA)
installed bishop Guo Jincai in Chengde, Hebei, without papal
approval, and forced other priests and church officials to attend the
ceremony.[<sup>10</sup>](#sdendnote10sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote10anc"></a>
 In response, the Holy See stated that the installation of an
“illegitimate” bishop and the forced attendance of others had
“unilaterally damaged the dialogue and the climate of trust that
had been established in [the Vatican’s] relations with the
Government of the People’s Republic of China.”[<sup>11</sup>](#sdendnote11sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote11anc"></a>
 As recently as December 2016—even as talks over the matter were
reportedly ongoing—the ordination of two new Vatican-approved
bishops was attended by another “illegitimate” bishop, creating
“unease for the two involved and turmoil among Chinese Catholics,”
according to the Holy See.[<sup>12</sup>](#sdendnote12sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote12anc"></a>

The pope apparently
hoped to conclude some sort of agreement with Beijing on bishop
ordination as part of the Jubilee Year of Mercy that ended on
November 20.[<sup>13</sup>](#sdendnote13sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote13anc"></a>
 While it does not appear that this informal deadline was met, talks
are apparently still ongoing.  On the table is the status of eight
bishops who have been installed by China but not ordained by the
Vatican (three of whom are excommunicated from the church).  Should
this initial resolution be met, the two sides could also seek to
establish a more formal system to select and ordain bishops that is
palatable to both Beijing and the Holy See.  Similar to an informal
system already in place in Vietnam, this mechanism would allow the
CPCA to provide a list of acceptable candidates and the Vatican to
select a bishop from this list.  There is also the matter of more
than two dozen Vatican-approved bishops who are not recognized by the
CPCA, some of whom are believed to be in prison.[<sup>14</sup>](#sdendnote14sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote14anc"></a><br/>

It is easy to see
why Pope Francis would want such an agreement.  Many dioceses in
China currently lack a bishop, or have a bishop who is already past
retirement age.  There is also the long-held desire to reconcile the
above- and underground churches, a splintered church that Pope
Benedict XVI described as not “normal” in his 2007 letter to
Chinese Catholics.[<sup>15</sup>](#sdendnote15sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote15anc"></a>
 As for lower-level church officials and the lay faithful, many of
them may support such an agreement if it paves the way for the pope
to visit China.[<sup>16</sup>](#sdendnote16sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote16anc"></a>
 Yet the potential agreement is not without controversy.  Bishop
Emeritus of Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen has publicly and forcefully
campaigned against the deal, saying that it makes the church “totally
subservient to an atheist government.”[<sup>17</sup>](#sdendnote17sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote17anc"></a>
 Others claim it is a betrayal to those underground Catholics in
China who have suffered through extreme repression in the past.

But what is the
calculus for Beijing, as it becomes ever more suspicious of foreign
influences?  The potential for damage is obvious: striking an
agreement on bishop ordination is a tacit admission that a foreign
entity plays an important role in religious life in China, perhaps
allowing for closer ties between Chinese Catholics and the Holy See.
Yu Zhengsheng’s speech at the December 2016 assembly of Chinese
Catholic Representatives once again reiterated this concern,
emphasizing the importance of patriotism, “independence, autonomy,
and self-management,” and the assimilation of Catholicism into
Chinese society.[<sup>18</sup>](#sdendnote18sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote18anc"></a>



Yet the upside is
not insignificant: Beijing could minimize conflict with many
underground Catholics if they felt they had the pope’s blessing to
unite with the state-affiliated church.  This would not only bring
more believers under Chinese religious authorities’ more direct
supervision, but would also give Beijing—as now in concord with the
pope—the cover to marginalize or crack down more harshly on those
Catholics who chose to remain underground.  The potential agreement,
as currently described in the press, would allow for state-affiliated
authorities to create the initial list of ordination candidates,
ensuring that no matter who is chosen, he would be politically
acceptable to Beijing.  Thus, the practical benefits of such a deal
could well outweigh the ideological dissonance it would create.  The
CCP may feel it has the leverage to ensure that any deal is on its
terms; at the December Chinese Catholic representatives’ assembly,
SARA head Wang Zuo’an said that China is willing to have a dialogue
with the Vatican, but hopes the Vatican would “take an even more
flexible and pragmatic attitude and take practical steps to bring
about advantageous conditions for an improvement in relations.”[<sup>19</sup>](#sdendnote19sym)<a class="anchor" id="sdendnote19anc"></a>
 As ever, the ultimate deciding factor will be whether the CCP judges
the agreement as hurting or as enhancing its ability to control
religion in China.
