**On September 10, 2021, I [testified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHC2tXt8jEY) before the Uyghur Tribunal about the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party, the PRC government, and policies in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.**

**Background on the Uyghur Tribunal, from the [Tribunal website](https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/features/chinafile-presents-camps-chinas-high-tech-penal-colony):**

*"It is alleged that the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) has and continues to perpetrate the most serious of international crimes against the Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Turkic Muslims in the Uyghur region of North West China.*

*In June 2020 Dolkun Isa, President of the World Uyghur Congress formally requested that Sir Geoffrey Nice QC establish and chair an independent people’s tribunal to investigate ‘ongoing atrocities and possible Genocide’ against the Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Turkic Muslim Populations. The Uyghur Tribunal (“Tribunal”) was launched on 3 September 2020 with assistance from a non-governmental organisation, the Coalition for Genocide Response.*


*The Tribunal will act wholly independently although it will continue to benefit from evidence provided by a range of organisations."*
