**This panel, organized by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide, took place in Washington, DC on March 5, 2020. Video of the event is available on the Center's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/CenterForThePreventionOfGenocide/videos/713037976093314/).**

>The Chinese government is persecuting Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, China, on the basis of their religion and ethnicity. Between one and three million Uyghurs—of a population of 12 million—are currently in some form of detention, and those who are not still face rapidly tightening control restricting their ability to express their identity. Watch a replay of our March 2020 event with experts discussing the situation.
