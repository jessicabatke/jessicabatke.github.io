I am currently a Non-Resident Fellow at the [Global Public Policy Institute (GPPi)](https://gppi.net/) in Berlin, where I research China's online censorship and its impacts worldwide. I am also a Senior Fellow at [ChinaFile](http://www.chinafile.com/), a Senior European Fellow at [Cybersecurity for Democracy](https://cybersecurityfordemocracy.org/), and a Senior Associate Fellow at the [Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS)](https://merics.org/en).

I was previously Senior Editor for Investigations at ChinaFile, where I worked on [data-driven](https://www.chinafile.com/state-surveillance-china) [research projects](https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/features/message-control-china). Before that, I was a foreign affairs research analyst in the U.S. State Department’s [Bureau of Intelligence and Research](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/bureaus-and-offices-reporting-directly-to-the-secretary/bureau-of-intelligence-and-research/); there, I focused on modern Chinese society as well as leadership and governance, including cultural, religious, ethnic, media, and political trends. I’ve spent time living in China, Kyrgyzstan, India, and Mexico.  I speak Chinese and (some) German.  There is Spanish and Uyghur buried in there too, somewhere.  

I received an M.A. in East Asian Studies from Stanford University and a B.A. in Linguistics from Pitzer College.
