I am currently a senior editor at [ChinaFile](http://www.chinafile.com/) in New York City, where I work on [data-driven](https://www.chinafile.com/state-surveillance-china) [research projects](https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/features/message-control-china). I am also the primary editor of [The China NGO Project](http://www.chinafile.com/ngo/).  

I am a member of the DC-based band [Gramophonic](https://www.gramophonic.band/) and the music director of the new folk musical [Tear a Root from the Earth](http://www.teararoot.com/).

Previously, I was a foreign affairs research analyst in the U.S. State Department’s [Bureau of Intelligence and Research](https://www.state.gov/bureaus-offices/bureaus-and-offices-reporting-directly-to-the-secretary/bureau-of-intelligence-and-research/), where I focused on modern Chinese society as well as leadership and governance, including cultural, religious, ethnic, media, and political trends.  In 2016, I was a Visiting Academic Fellow at the [Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS)](https://www.merics.org/en) in Berlin.  I’ve also spent time living in China, Kyrgyzstan, India, and Mexico.  I speak Chinese, (some) Uyghur, and (some) German.  There is Spanish buried in there too, somewhere.  

I received an M.A. in East Asian Studies from Stanford University and a B.A. in Linguistics from Pitzer College.
